# NFT-Creator

For my final project at the web development bootcamp, I wanted to dive into the experience of building on blockchain in order to make web3 accessible. 

Peppermint is the easiest way for people to get started with web3 and generate NFTs from their artwork. This gives you the ability to create unique tokens that are not tied to any marketplace, so you have complete control over your assets. 😀

KEY FEATURES:


🔑 Easy crypto wallet creation using the Fortmatic API. No seed phrases needed.

🏞 Profile gallery in one that showcases all the NFTs you have created within the platform 

💎 Mint your artwork and turn it into an NFT with a simple 3 step process

👤 Straightforward customization of what info gets displayed on your profile

👁 View your NFT in the block explorer

🗑 Ability to delete a specific NFT from your gallery 




STRETCH GOALS (THAT I DIDN'T EVEN GET A CHANCE TO GET STARTED ON):


🚀 Show a feed of all NFTs in the blockchain separate from the profile gallery

👤 Copy to dashboard when clicking your crypto wallet address in profile
